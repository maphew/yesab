# YESAB API
  
The public API is under [https://yesabregistry.ca/api/integration/projects](https://yesabregistry.ca/api/integration/projects)

 - *Also see [YESAB project file map](https://yesab.ca/project-map)*
  
With query parameters, such as of startYear and endYear:
[https://yesabregistry.ca/api/integration/projects?startYear=2024&amp;endYear=2025](https://yesabregistry.ca/api/integration/projects?startYear=2024&amp;endYear=2025)

Get direct records by **path** and **not query** parameters (&amp; and ?):
  
by Project Number
[https://yesabregistry.ca/api/integration/projects/2023-0053](https://yesabregistry.ca/api/integration/projects/2023-0053)
  
by Project ID:
[https://yesabregistry.ca/api/integration/projects/86edab28-da07-47d0-bc82-bf16223f9256](https://yesabregistry.ca/api/integration/projects/86edab28-da07-47d0-bc82-bf16223f9256)

The API will silently return 0 bytes but no error if it doesn't like the size the returned results. So chunk the start and end years by 2 or 3, e.g. startYear=2024&amp;endYear=2026.

There don't appear to be queries like "list all project ID's or Names in the system".

| summary | "The Project is a proposed road to support the Proponent’s current and future placer mining and exploration operations in that area (currently PM20-041-1). The Project will consist of the on and off-claim construction (up to 2.8 km), upgrading (up to 11.1 km), and use of a new year-round road, including the installation of up to two new culverts. The road will connect the road system at Rude Creek with the barge landing at the mouth of Britannia Creek on the Yukon River.\nRoad construction will begin as soon as permitted and is expected to occur over the course of two seasons. Annual road maintenance will be undertaken as required. Road use will occur until road decommissioning; either when the Casino Tote Road is upgraded to an all-weather road or until the expiry of PM15-083 (2026) and PM20-041-1 (2030). The project area is approximately 100 km west of Pelly Crossing and 86 km northwest of Minto, located within the Selkirk First Nation Traditional Territory and Asserted Territory of the White River First Nation.\nThe Project was originally deemed an amendment to YESAB 2022-0057 however, the Proponent has identified that the Project will not support YESAB 2022-0057, but other placer mining and exploration operations in the same area (ie. PM20-041-1).\nChanges to the Project Scope are highlighted in BoldRevised temporal scope is highlighted in Bold Underline\n" |
